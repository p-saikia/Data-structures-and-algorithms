'''
James found a love letter that his friend Harry has written to his girlfriend. James is a prankster, so he decides to meddle with the letter. He changes all the words in the letter into palindromes.

To do this, he follows two rules:

He can only reduce the value of a letter by , i.e. he can change d to c, but he cannot change c to d or d to b.
The letter a may not be reduced any further.
Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single operation. Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given string into a palindrome.

For example, given the string , the following two operations are performed: cde → cdd → cdc.
